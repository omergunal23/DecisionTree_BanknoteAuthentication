# DecisionTree_BanknoteAuthentication
ELE489-Fundamentals of Machine Learning HW2

In this project, Decision Tree algorithm is applied on the Banknote Authentication dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset consists of 1372 instances with 4 numerical features and a binary class label (0: fake, 1: authentic).
The decision tree algorithm is tested with different parameters such as: Maximum depth of the tree, minimum samples neeeded for splitting the data and criterion for choosing the root node are changed to find the best accuracy result. Feature importance for the parameters are extracted and plotted. Finally, confusion matrix and classification report is provided to analyze the results.

1. Dataset is loaded and visualized which is taken from this website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication
2. Decision Tree algorithm is applied on this dataset with changing paremeters by using for loops. Paramters can be rearranged inside them.
3. Finally, to analyze results output reports are plotted.
